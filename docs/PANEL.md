# Panel reference

The simple mode and the advanced panel are also the *Simple* and *Advanced* tabs of the
PipeCompare window (`pipecompare.start`; see the README, *In the PipeCompare window*), with the
same controls; there, Run shows its progress and result on the window's *Run* and *Results*
pages.

## Simple mode (*Compare pipelines…*, `pop_pipecompare`)

Two choices (what to measure; for ERP, the event types); the steps are preselected:

1. **Data**, described from the data: epoched data offer ERP measures, continuous data with
   events ERP measures and band power, continuous data without events band power. The line also
   gives the montage check: channels that do not resemble their neighbours, whose labels may not
   match the positions (see the README, *Montage check*); a warning only.
2. **Measure**, one list of what the data support: the ERP components, *your own window and
   electrodes*, the bands, and *your own band and electrodes*. For your own measure, type two
   numbers (window in ms after the event, e.g. `300 600`, or band in Hz, e.g. `8 12`) and pick
   the electrodes with *Electrodes…* (EEGLAB's channel list; a band starts with all EEG
   channels). Your own window uses a −200 ms epoch start and a −200–0 ms baseline, and the band
   lengthens the segments to hold two cycles of its low edge. A preset's electrodes can be
   changed the same way: its window (or band) is shown, fixed, next to *Electrodes…*, which starts
   from the component's ERP CORE site(s) (a preset band from all EEG channels); not for N2pc and
   LRP, which are scored on their electrode pair. Several electrodes are averaged (ERP: the
   waveform; band power: each electrode's power). ERP: the time-locking event
   types. Each type is one condition,
   or tick *Score the selected event types as one condition* when several codes mean one
   condition (e.g. one code per block). `boundary` markers are not offered; on epoched data the
   types the epochs are time-locked to are preselected. A condition with fewer events than the
   search needs (10) is flagged before *Run*, which stays off. The component's
   epoch, baseline, electrode sites and mean-amplitude window are those of ERP CORE (Kappenman et
   al., 2021, Tables 1 and 2): N170 PO8 110–150 ms; MMN FCz 125–225 ms; N2pc PO7/PO8 200–275 ms;
   N400 CPz 300–500 ms; P3 Pz 300–600 ms; LRP C3/C4 −100–0 ms (response-locked); ERN FCz 0–100
   ms (response-locked). N2pc and LRP are scored contralateral minus ipsilateral, as ERP CORE
   measures them: the dialog then shows two lists, the event types with the target on the left
   and on the right (LRP: left-hand and right-hand responses), and each trial's score is the
   electrode contralateral to its side minus the other. The other components score each
   condition's waveform at their sites (for MMN this ranks the pipelines as the deviant-minus-
   standard difference wave does). Band power: delta 1–4, theta 4–8, alpha 8–13, beta 13–30
   Hz over all EEG channels, in 2 s segments.
3. **Compare**: a list of steps in the order they run, each with a tick box: bad channels
   (detect and interpolate), the reference (item 4), ICA (ICLabel threshold compared), high-pass,
   low-pass (cutoffs compared), epochs and baseline (always; segments for band power), epoch
   rejection (amplitude limit compared) and, under it, *measure the limit peak-to-peak in 200 ms
   windows* (`'peaktopeak'`: ERP CORE's moving-window test, limits 100, 150, 200 µV compared
   instead) and *instead, repair epochs with up to 3
   channels over the limit* (`'epochinterp'`: such an epoch keeps those channels, interpolated
   within the epoch; it uses the rejection's limit, so it can only be ticked with it, and adds no
   pipelines; with the average reference the data are averaged again after it). Any of them can be
   ticked; the order is fixed (to change it, use the panel). *Standard* (preselected) ticks every
   step but the repair, *Filters only* the two filters (`'recipe'` in `pop_pipecompare`; other sets
   with `'steps'`, e.g. `{'highpass', 'lowpass', 'reject'}`). With fewer than two pipelines, as with only the filters
   on epoched data, *Run* stays off. Each compared step searches the catalog's default lists.
   Steps the data cannot take are greyed out with the reason next to them (filters on epoched
   data; bad channels and ICA without channel locations; ICA without ICLabel or after ICA
   components were already removed); beside a step the data already had, a note says so (e.g.
   *the data are already high-passed at 0.5 Hz: stricter cutoffs and keeping it are compared*).
   With the average reference the bad-channel step is always ticked. For band power, when ICA or
   epoch rejection is ticked, each filter uses one edge, the catalog value nearest the band
   outside it (outside the band a filter does not change its power): 9 pipelines for all steps;
   with only the filters ticked their cutoffs are compared. Bad channels are detected
   once (kurtosis, joint probability or noise the other channels do not explain, z = 5, on a 1 Hz high-passed, 40 Hz low-passed copy; the channels are interpolated in the data as
   they are, except one whose interpolation would measurably raise the total error) and ICA is fitted once, before the filters, so every filter choice shares
   one decomposition (fitted on a 1 Hz high-passed copy; filtering and unmixing are linear, so
   their order does not change the data). Non-EEG channels (typed EOG, ECG, … or named so, such
   as VEOG, HEOG, ECG1) are not tested as bad channels and are ignored by epoch rejection. ASR is compared from the panel or a script. The number
   of pipelines (and of ICA decompositions) is shown live. Steps the data or the installation
   cannot support are left out, with the reason: no channel locations, no ICLabel, or data that
   are already epoched. Filter edges the data already have (read from the history) are not
   compared: they would leave the data unchanged but still filter the known signal; instead,
   keeping the data's own filter (no further filter) is compared with the stricter edges. Above the search limit (500) *Run* stays off; use *Advanced…* to fix
   some values.
4. **Reference** (a line of the step list): *as recorded* (default) or *average*, a fixed step of
   every pipeline placed after the bad channels are interpolated (otherwise a bad channel spreads
   into every channel) and before ICA, whichever steps are ticked; the same non-EEG channels are left out of the
   average. Data that are already average-referenced are averaged again after the interpolation,
   which removes the bad channels' share of the earlier average. It is not
   searched: the reference changes what is measured, so it is chosen for your analysis, not by
   noise. Filtering and re-referencing are both linear, so their order does not matter.

*Run* shows a progress window (pipelines done, the step running now, time so far, time left)
with *Stop*: stopping keeps the pipelines already run, and the result covers those. The time left
is estimated from the pipelines after the first, which alone runs the shared steps (ICA
included); until it is done the bar moves without filling. Data stored in volts are recognised
from the amplitude scale and compared in µV. The Command Window prints every EEGLAB command and
every finished pipeline as the search runs, then a summary; the same log is kept in
`pipecompare_last_run.log` in MATLAB's `tempdir`, replaced by the next run.

*Advanced…* opens the panel below with these choices filled in. When the choices cannot be filled in (e.g. a component's electrode is missing), it says
why and the dialog stays open. The result window says in one
sentence which pipeline to use and why, naming pipelines by the settings compared (e.g. high-pass
0.5 Hz, low-pass 30 Hz), lists it (*) with the best others (checks, noise (SME), trials kept,
signal change, settings) above one line with the steps every pipeline shares. When ICA did
nothing useful (ICLabel recognised almost no component, or none was removed) or had too little
data, and when one channel caused most of the recommended pipeline's rejected epochs, the
headline says so. *Show all
pipelines* lists every pipeline with the reason it was excluded. *Use this pipeline* builds the
pipeline again (with the ICA decomposition of the comparison) as a new EEGLAB dataset, which is in memory
until saved; a pipeline that did not pass the checks is used only after a confirmation that says
why. *Save script…* writes a function that runs the steps on any recording.

## Panel (*Advanced panel…*)

Open EEGLAB > Tools > PipeCompare > *Advanced panel…*. PipeCompare has no load step: it
always works on the current EEGLAB dataset and never modifies it during a search. Each candidate
runs on its own copy.

- **History and state.** The left side shows the live `EEG.history`, parsed line by line. The top
  shows the dataset's state (including channel locations) and any inconsistency between data and
  history, with the montage check first when it flags channels (also printed in the Command
  Window).
- **Analysis contract, from EEGLAB's own dialogs.** Conditions are picked from the dataset's event
  list (*Add from events…*); the trials that count from markers, an EEGLAB data selection
  (`pop_select`) or event selection (`pop_selectevent`); the epoch from `pop_epoch`; the baseline from
  `pop_rmbase` (ms converted to s); the ROI from EEGLAB's channel selection. When a dialog sets
  something the contract cannot hold as is (epoch events that differ from the conditions, epoch
  options, a baseline on a channel subset), the panel asks which to keep. A trial rule belongs to
  the recording it was set on and is reset (or flagged) when another recording becomes current. *View ERP* opens
  `pop_timtopo`, *Chan. locations…* opens `pop_chanedit`. The text fields stay editable and show
  the trials per condition under the rule; a condition with fewer trials than *min trials* is
  flagged there, and *Run search* then says so instead of searching (every pipeline would be
  excluded).
- **Components.** *Add component…* offers the ERP CORE components of the simple mode (window and
  electrodes; the epoch and baseline too when those fields are empty) or your own (name, window,
  measure, electrodes). N2pc and LRP are scored contralateral minus ipsilateral: you say which
  conditions have the target (response hand) on the left, and the component gets `# contra`
  with, for each condition in order, the electrode contralateral to it, e.g.
  `N2pc: 0.2 0.275 @ PO7 PO8 # contra PO8 PO7` for conditions left, right.
- **Measure: ERP components or band power.** *Band power* (continuous data) replaces the
  components with bands (`name: low high @ channels`, in Hz; *Add band…* offers delta, theta,
  alpha and beta as in the simple mode, or your own edges, then the electrodes, all EEG channels
  to start with). The data are cut into consecutive segments of the given length (2 s to start
  with; at least two cycles of the lowest band edge), which are the trials: conditions, epoch and
  baseline are not used, the plan's *epoch* step cuts the segments, and a *baseline* step does not
  belong in the plan. Trials can still be limited by time ranges or markers.
- **Nothing is prefilled for a particular study.** Conditions, epoch and components start empty.
  Defaults that are used are stated and come from conventions or from the data: an empty baseline
  is the pre-stimulus interval [epoch start, 0]; an empty epoch on epoched data is the data's own
  epochs; the line-noise frequency (50/60 Hz) and the data unit (uV/V) are judged from the
  recording; resampling has no default rate. Constraint limits and the catalog's search lists are
  general starting values, shown in the panel and editable.
- **Plan.** Add steps in the order they should run. The table shows every parameter as it will
  run (one value = fixed, several = searched, defaults marked). *Configure in EEGLAB…* opens the
  step's EEGLAB dialog: its values join the step, and a value that differs from those already there
  becomes a searched candidate; settings the step cannot hold (e.g. asymmetric limits) are kept as
  the whole EEGLAB command if you choose so. Each dialog opens on the data as the plan has them at
  that step (the current dataset's first 120 s run through the steps before it). *Add EEGLAB menu
  step…* adds any operation of EEGLAB's menus, plugins included (e.g. CleanLine, ERPLAB): its own
  dialog opens and the command it returns becomes a step whose arguments can be searched.
  *Edit values…* lists the parameters (channel lists picked in EEGLAB's channel list). *Skipping allowed*, *Must come before…* and the *pin* column
  control alternatives and order. As in the simple mode, an added bad-channel, re-reference or
  epoch-rejection step leaves the non-EEG channels (EOG, ECG, ...) out, and an added bad-channel
  step uses kurtosis, joint probability or noise the other channels do not explain (z = 5) on a 1 Hz
  high-passed copy of continuous data, low-passed to the band the analysis keeps (40 Hz for ERPs),
  and interpolates a bad channel unless that would measurably raise the total error (`repair` `error`);
  the table shows these values and *Edit values…* changes them. Every epoch-rejection step also
  has `interpolate` (default 0, off): an epoch failed by at most that many channels keeps them,
  interpolated within the epoch, instead of being rejected; several values (e.g. `0 | 3`) are
  compared. The amplitude rejection (`reject_threshold`) has `method` (`absolute` or
  `peaktopeak`, both can be compared) and `window` (ms, for peak-to-peak). The ICA step has
  `fitClean` (1: fit without the stretches far noisier than the rest; 0: on all of the data).
  Channels interpolated or removed
  after an average reference must be followed by another average reference (see
  [METHODS.md](METHODS.md)): an order search never puts the average first, and a fixed order that
  does is refused with the reason.
- **Apply now in EEGLAB.** Runs the step on the current dataset through EEGLAB's own menu code path
  (`EEG.history`, `ALLCOM`, new dataset), so the plan starts after it.
- **Run search / Options… / Resume…** A progress window shows the pipelines done, the step running
  now, the time so far and the time left; *Stop* (or closing it) stops after the current step and ranks the pipelines already finished.
  Every command and score is printed in the Command Window and the result is stored in
  `pipecompare_result`. Options: data unit, checkpoint folder, parallel, fine-tune filter cutoffs, check ICA's random start (the deciding pipelines with ICA run again with ICA started in 2 other ways), signal check with own waveform. Below the results the
  panel says what the dialog's result window says: that the settings make no difference, what to
  try when no pipeline passed, how large a difference the data can show, when ICA did nothing
  useful or had too little data, when one channel caused most rejected epochs, and when filters applied before PipeCompare already change the known signal beyond a
  pipeline's limit.
- **Results.** Selecting a row shows its full pipeline, reason, measures and commands below the
  table. *Inspect selected* opens a rebuilt candidate (not adopted) or the source in EEGLAB's
  viewers; *Adopt* stores a candidate as a new EEGLAB dataset whose `EEG.history` reproduces it,
  and says that these data are to be averaged and measured as they are.
  *Print script* prints the exact EEGLAB commands on this dataset; *Save script…* writes a function
  that runs the steps on any recording (as in the dialog's result window).

What the evaluation and ranking compute is described in [METHODS.md](METHODS.md).
